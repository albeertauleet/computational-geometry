In this lab we had to incrementally construct a triangulation of a set of points in the plane. Starting from an initial enclosing triangle containing all the input points, the points had to be added one at a time. At each step, the new point was inserted into the current triangulation by finding the triangle it fell into and replacing it with three new triangles connecting the newly inserted point to the vertices of the disappearing triangle. Part of the code was provided by Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya
